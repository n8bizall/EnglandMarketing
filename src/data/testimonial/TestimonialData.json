For example she took 2 hours of her own time to come meet with me face to face. A quality that seems more & more rare among companies. She very clearly explained the function of her service, what was to be expected in terms of gains, and has delivered through & through. The pricing in my opinion is extremely affordable. Especially for the amount of time that is spent on my company alone. Always has constant and clear communication and keeps my interests updated. ”",
